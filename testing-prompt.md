study specs/README.md
then study the evaluation checklist in specs/TESTING_PLAN.md and pick the most important thing to do, or create an exploratory test of your own based on the CLI's functionality defined in specs/PLAN.md (only read PLAN.md if you are doing a custom exploratory test). evaluate the specific feature, functionality, or user story you've decided on and use the elemental CLI to track any issues (bugs, UX, docs, or enhancements) in this repo

IMPORTANT:

- ALWAYS run your evaluations in a /tmp folder to prevent mixing tests with the tasks stored in this repo
- ALWAYS create tasks/deps for tracking issues in this repo
- check for duplicates before creating a new task in this repo
- add dependencies for issues created if they exist (either from existing tasks or new ones)
- update the checklist in specs/TESTING_PLAN.md when you're done
- create or update any corresponding specs in specs/ with new planned features / functionality / improvements
- commit and push once all tasks/deps have been created and specs have been updated
- ALWAYS exit after finishing your task and pushing your changes
